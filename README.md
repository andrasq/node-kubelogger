Quick logger for apps running inside Kubernetes containers.

A Kubelogger is a `qlogger` that is wired to convert all output to K8s compatible json
bundles and write them to the process stdout.  Different log streams can be distinguished by
their `type`.  All kubelogger output is written to stdout as newline terminated json bundles.
Each bundle has fields `time` and `type`, plus the `message`.

Kubelogger is an object logger where ideally each `message` is an object.  Already serialized
objects will be logged as strings, and will get doubly stringified.


Quick Start
-----------

        const kubelogger = require('kubelogger');

        const appLogger = kubelogger('debug', 'MyApp');
        appLogger.info('app running');
        // => {"time":"2019-02-05T20:15:45.830Z","type":"MyApp","message":"app running"}

        const consoleLogger = kubelogger('info', 'console')
            .captureWrites(process.stdout)
            .captureWrites(process.stderr);
        console.log('Hello, world.');
        process.stderr.write('Oops!');
        // => {"time":"2019-02-05T20:13:13.240Z","type":"console","message":"Hello, world.\n"}
        // => {"time":"2019-02-05T20:13:13.241Z","type":"console","message":"Oops!\n"}


API
---

### logger = kubelogger( loglevel, type )

Create a new logger.  The default loglevel is 'info', the default type 'undefined'.

The logger is `instanceof qlogger` with a predefined filter to convert all log messages into
json bundles, and a predefined writer to write the bundle to the process stdout.  Note that
unlike an ordinary `qlogger`, a `kubelogger` will apply its built-in serializer filter as the
last filtering step even if other filters are added.

The json bundles have properties `time`, `type` and `message`.  Time is formatted like
`Date.toISOString()`, but much faster (faster than `String(Date.now())`; faster even than
`String(count++)`).  Type is as received by the constructor.  The message is the JSON
stringified string or object being logged.

        const logger = kubelogger('info', 'example');
        logger.info('test');
        // => {"time":"2019-02-05T20:13:14.481Z","type":"example","message":"test\n"}
        logger.warn({ code: 'green', ok: 1 });
        // => {"time":"2019-02-05T20:13:14.482Z","type":"example","message":{"code":"green","ok":1}}

### logger.captureWrites( stream )

Convert all writes to the given stream into log messages sent to this logger.  Log message
formatting and output is handled as described above.  Only one logger cap capture a stream,
the last capture will get the stream data.

The written data must be 'string' or 'Buffer', object mode is not supported and throws a
TypeError.  Buffers are converted to utf8 and are logged as text.  The assumption is that
Buffers contain complete log messages not binary data, so utf8 chars split across data
chunks will not work right.

        const logger = kubelogger('info', 'stdout').captureWrites(process.stdout);
        console.log('gotcha!');
        // => {"time":"2019-02-05T20:13:14.483Z","type":"stdout","message":"gotcha!\n"}

### logger.restoreWrites( stream )

Undo a `captureWrites`, restore normal write behavior on the stream.  Not normally needed
inside a container, but is useful for testing, and just in case.

### logger.close( callback )

Flush pending output, restore the captured writes, and invoke `callback` with any deferred
logging error(s).  Call when exiting the app to not leave unwritten messages in the buffers.
